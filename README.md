# Income and Education Scores  

## __Investigation:__  
* Are state test scores in CA alongside location information indicative of median income?
* Can this be used to bridge achievement gaps by updating funding formulas for education?  

## __Tools:__  
* Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup
* Data Engineering: SQLite
* Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn 

## __Details:__  
* Worked with SBAC 2018 test score set with over 3,250,000 rows of raw data.
* Automated data extraction and transformation processes.
* Achieved 0.102 RMSE of predicting the log median household income. 
* I believe the findings should be considered as a factor towards funding.

## __Next Steps:__
* See if trends continue across other US states.
* Try classification by binning income into tiers.
* Train other model types that are CPU intensive on cloud service provider.
